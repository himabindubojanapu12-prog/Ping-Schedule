# Ping-Schedule

Recruiters spend significant time coordinating interview schedules through back-and-forth emails, causing delays, scheduling conflicts, and increased administrative workload. Manual processes reduce efficiency and negatively impact candidate experience. There is a need for an intelligent system that can automatically negotiate interview times, understand availability, and update calendars without human intervention. The proposed solution is an autonomous scheduling agent that communicates via email or chat, analyzes candidate responses, selects optimal time slots, confirms meetings, and integrates with calendar APIs to ensure conflict-free bookings, improving efficiency, accuracy, and overall experience.


Our solution is an AI-powered autonomous interview scheduling agent that eliminates manual coordination between recruiters and candidates. Once the recruiter provides the candidate’s email and job title, the system takes full control of the scheduling process. It connects to Google Calendar to fetch real-time availability and sends professionally formatted interview slot options via email. When the candidate replies in natural language, the system uses Anthropic’s Claude to interpret the message and extract structured date and time information. The agent compares both parties’ availability, selects a suitable slot, books the meeting automatically, and sends confirmation emails with calendar invites. If no matching slot is found, it proposes new times. If the candidate declines or no resolution is possible, the recruiter is notified instantly. The system runs continuously, checking for responses and updating status without human intervention. Designed with a modular architecture, it integrates email services, calendar APIs, and AI processing into a single intelligent loop, ensuring faster scheduling, zero double-bookings, improved candidate experience, and reduced recruiter workload.
